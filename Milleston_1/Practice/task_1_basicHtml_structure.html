        <p>Travelling is a vital facet of personal development and cultural enrichment. Travelling broadens one’s
            horizons, and fosters tolerance and understanding of diverse cultures. On the positive side of travelling is
            that it allows one to break free from their routine, and travel and stimulates creativity and
            problem-solving skills. <br><br>
            One should make sure they travel at least once a year. By doing so, it will act as a motivation for
            self-discovery, building confidence and allowing one to navigate several unfamiliar territories. Moreover,
            it creates long-lasting memories as well as bonds with friends or other people. <br><br>

            Travelling to new places and exploring nature’s wonders, historical landmarks, or vibrant cities imbues us
            with valuable experiences. It also promotes lifelong learning as well as appreciation for the beauty and
            diversity of our world. All in all, travelling to new places acts as an investment in both personal
            development and in terms of creating connections with new people.
